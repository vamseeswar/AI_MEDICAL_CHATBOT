INFO:__main__:Processed response from llama_scout: The image presents a complex neural network architecture, comprising both encoder and decoder components. The encoders are situated on the left side of the image, within a pink box labeled "ENCODER."

**Encoder Components:**

*   **Input Embedding:** The encoder takes in inputs and applies input embedding.
*   **Multi-Head Attention:** The embedded inputs then pass through a multi-head attention mechanism, which is represented by a blue box.
*   **Add & Norm:** The output from the multi-head attention is fed into an "Add & Norm" layer, depicted in purple.
*   **Feed Forward:** The result from the "Add & Norm" layer is then processed by a feed-forward network, shown in red.
*   **Add & Norm (Second Instance):** The output from the feed-forward network is again passed through another "Add & Norm" layer.

These components are repeated N times, as indicated by the label "Nx" above the encoder and decoder boxes.

In summary, the encoders in this picture consist of the following layers:

*   Input Embedding
*   Multi-Head Attention
*   Add & Norm
*   Feed Forward
*   Add & Norm (second instance)

These layers are stacked N times to form the encoder architecture.
INFO:__main__:Processed response from llama_maverick: The encoders in the picture are the components within the dashed rectangle labeled "ENCODER". The architecture of the encoder consists of the following layers, repeated N times:

*   **Input Embedding and Positional Encoding**: The input embedding is added to the positional encoding.
*   **Multi-Head Attention**: This layer is followed by an "ADD & NORM" layer.
*   **Feed Forward**: This layer is also followed by an "ADD & NORM" layer.

These layers are the key components of the encoder, and they are repeated N times to form the encoder architecture.

Therefore, the encoders in the picture are the **Nx Encoder Layers**, where each layer consists of Multi-Head Attention and Feed Forward layers with "ADD & NORM" layers in between.
